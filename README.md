# Introduction

This repository is created for the Assignment 1 of STAT 545B. 

In this assignment, we practiced writing, documenting, and testing a R function. I wrote a function that makes a ggplot to visualize the proportion of missing values for all or selected columns in a data frame.

Anyone who is interested in the R function that I wrote can download the *Assignment 1.Rmd* and play with the code chunks in Rstudio. Or you can just view the project by taking a look at the *Assignment-1.md* file.
